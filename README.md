Working on an update.




PHP Terminal Emulator
=====================

This is designed to be a stand-alone Terminal Emulator useful for when you
don't have ssh access.
I am working to use this in a browser window.

Installation
------------
Yoy can leave this with no user name or password.
OR
In line number 10 change "false" to "true"
Scroll down to "user" and "password" and enter user name and password.
